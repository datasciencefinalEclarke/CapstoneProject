1. Title and brief description
Capstone Project - Data Science (INFS 692) - Master of Information Studies, McGill University.
This is the capstone project of INFS 692 at McGill University. 

2. Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop different models to predict the endpoint of the radiomics signature based from MRI, PET and CT scans.
I created an ensemble classification model, using KNN (capstone_model_1_1, logistical regression (capstone_model_1_2), and decision tree (capstone_model_1_3) methods.
I then created a neural network-based classification model (capstone_model_2. Then, without considering the binary output and categorical variables in the dataset, I
compared the following clustering technique results:
  o K-Means (capstone_model_3_1)
  o Hierarchical (capstone_model_3_2)
  o Model Based (capstone_model_3_3)

I completed these tasks using RStudio 4.2.2.
 
I faced some challenges with trying to interpret the clustering models. I used external resources, such as GitHub and R-Blogger pages, 
to better understand how to interpret the models.

3. How To View
The .RMD files can be viewed in RStudio. The PDFs can be viewed in Adobe or Google Chrome.
